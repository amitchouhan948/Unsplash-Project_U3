      l:"Get to know the amazing Unsplash Community",
      dis1:"Need a quick serotonin boost? Easy. Give Amy Shamblen’s Unsplash profile a quick browse. Her combination of colour, composition and quirkiness are sure to leave you feeling a little more joyful.",
      dis2:"Here at Unsplash, we’ve long admired Amy’s bright and bold visuals and clear sense of style. So naturally, we decided to catch up with Amy to learn a little bit more about her interests, photography process, and more",
      q1:"Who are you & where are you based?",
      a1:"My name is Amy Shamblen and I’m based in New York City with an additional studio in Akron, Ohio, which is where I originally started.",
      q2:"Why did you first get started in photography?",
      a2:"I initially went to school for graphic design and started my career as an art director. I always wanted to start my own business, but had very corporate clients at the time and wanted to expand my client base to more whimsical, quirky brands. As a way to market myself, I started taking bold, colorful photos as a way to attract to that clientele (and also raise my spirits as I was in a funk at that time). I would post my work all over Unsplash and other social media channels, and soon enough, I started getting inquiries for custom photography and 5 years later, here I am! My background in design strongly contributes to my graphic photography style. I’ve always been interested in photography, but the route to get to this career wasn’t so linear.",

      a3:"Share your work all over! Don’t worry if it’s not “perfect” or if you feel no one sees it—if you are consistent everyday, those little steps will pay off.",

      q4:"What is your favorite topic to photograph?",
      a4:"Food! Though food isn’t always the most tame of photo subjects (I’m looking at you, dripping honey), there’s nothing more exciting than seeing that finished photo that drives your appetite. I love getting messy, too. I remember this typographic concept I did that said “Eat More Pie” in whipped cream with pieces of pie around it. There’s lots of trial and error to get the type to come out correctly, and you’re also racing against the clock before the cream melts, but I like the messy rush ;)",

      q5:"What are your top photography goals?",
      a5:"I want to continue to develop my style. Often my friends will send me some of my work they’ve seen in an ad and go “that’s Amy’s work!” and it makes me so glad to see that—but I’ve noticed hard light photography really take off since I’ve started and I want to further push myself to expand on it and stay unique.",
      q6:"What are your hobbies outside of photography?",
      a6:"Ah, so many! It varies between crocheting, cooking, running, hiking—if it’s something to keep me busy, I’ll likely do it. Napping is also included ;)",
      q7:"What do you listen to while editing photos?",
      a7:"Editing is therapy for me, so I tend to listen to music that calms me. Some of my favorites at the moment are Simon & Garfunkel, Bob Dylan, Elliott Smith, Nick Drake—music in that vein. Photographing is a different beast, and I usually listen to some sort of energetic 80’s vibes.",

      q1:"How does your identity and sense of self filter into your work?",
      a1:"The biggest part that identity plays in my photography is what I find myself feeling drawn to make images of. In my own work, I explore a lot of themes of identity and self, but in my freelance work, I also find myself being really excited and engaged in projects that allow me to work with other queer people. There’s a really keen sense of the importance of perception when it comes to queer and trans bodies, and having that lived experience myself helps me to be more thoughtful and compassionate with the people I’m working with.",
      q2:"Why is it so important for stock photography to represent the LGBTQ+ community?",
      a2:"Just like with other historically underrepresented identities, normalizing queer bodies in the media we consume is a very humanizing experience. It’s important that we see queer people not just when we’re talking about queer identities and experiences, but also when we’re talking about everyday normal life experiences like going in for a check-up at the dentist or taking your dog for a walk. Queer people are everywhere, just living our normal daily lives, and there’s no reason we shouldn’t see that represented in media.",

      a3:"We’re coming into a time where culturally we see people really living as their authentic selves. That’s what I’d like to see more of in the imagery we consume, including stock photography. Gender and sexuality are just two parts of our identities, but being able to openly express those two parts of our identities can also open us up to explore so many other parts of ourselves. The vast array of ways that we can present ourselves outwardly to the world is so beautiful to me.",

      q6:"What does Pride mean to you?",
      a6:"Celebrating our beautiful existence and not listening to how the white man has taught us to celebrate ourselves.",

      l:"How the Unsplash community wants to see Pride reflected in stock photography by Anna Selle, Shingi Rice and M. Cooper.",
      dis1:"A lot of work goes into taking a photograph. Before the inevitable ‘click’ — chances are you spent time planning what gear you’d bring, checking the weather conditions for the day, experimenting with camera settings, and finding the perfect framing for your shot.But what happens next is equally transformative.Editing. Some photographers love it, many simply put up with it — but the reality is: editing has the power to elevate and enhance what you’ve worked hard to capture. We spoke with three Unsplash contributors about all things editing — from their top tips for beginners looking to improve their skills, to their approach to the editing process.",
      dis2:"Philipp Pilz is also a designer. But for him, photography has been part of his life since childhood. He first recalls taking photos of cars as a child with a “cheap plastic film camera” before taking party pictures in clubs as a teenager. While he’s been photographing for about 20 years now, it was only when he turned to nature in the last four years that he believes truly found his style. Now, he travels through Europe in his camper van in search of exciting motifs and wild sceneries.",
      q1:"The Editing Process",
      a1:"Philipp typically works in Adobe Lightroom, and in Photoshop on rare occaision. His editing process typically goes something like this: “The first thing I do is apply the color look to my images. This is a custom preset that I developed and refined over a long process. This setting includes pretty much all the controls that are available in Adobe Lightroom: Color, Calibration, Tone Curves, and so on. After that comes the local adjustments — bringing out certain areas and darkening others again. Finally, I clean up the image, removing anything that might interfere with the view of the subject.",

      a2:"Just like with other historically underrepresented identities, normalizing queer bodies in the media we consume is a very humanizing experience.

      q3:"Top Editing Tips for Beginners",
      a3:"When it comes to tips for beginners looking to improve their editing skills, all photographers agree: Nothing replaces practice.Lerone advises beginners to “go out and shoot as much as possible. Try to shoot in different conditions, and experiment with different equipment and editing software to find your niche.”Simone agrees that there’s really just one way to take your editing to the next level: “Keep doing it.” She says, “With every edit you get a little better. Keep asking yourself: Is this the best I can do at this stage and time?”",

      q4:"Edit with a fresh frame of mind",
      a4:"Philipp tells us, “Editing is a very long process for me.” He typically edits photos quickly first to narrow down the selection of final images in his head. Then? He waits. “I often leave the images for days… or weeks. Then, I reevaluate.” And the cycle continues. Philipp tells us it’s often months before he’s ready to hit publish.",

      img6:"https://unsplash.com/blog/content/images/2022/05/fom9m4bw.png",
      q5:"Learn to love the editing process",
      a5:"Ultimately, the key to enjoying editing? Embracing it for what it is. For Simone, what she loves most is “the contrast of being outside in the real world and then diving into the virtual ‘Photoshop Universe’.”Philipp also enjoys the contrast between photography and editing.  In fact, he almost prefers it to taking the photos themselves. “It probably has something to do with the convenience of sitting at home in an armchair rather than setting the alarm for 4am to photograph the sunrise on the French cliffs.”",
      q6:"What does Pride mean to you?",
      a6:"Celebrating our beautiful existence and not listening to how the white man has taught us to celebrate ourselves.",
      q7:"What do you listen to while editing photos?",

      a1:"The biggest part that identity plays in my photography is what I find myself feeling drawn to make images of. In my own work, I explore a lot of themes of identity and self, but in my freelance work, I also find myself being really excited and engaged in projects that allow me to work with other queer people. There’s a really keen sense of the importance of perception when it comes to queer and trans bodies, and having that lived experience myself helps me to be more thoughtful and compassionate with the people I’m working with.",
      q2:"Why is it so important for stock photography to represent the LGBTQ+ community?",
      a2:"Just like with other historically underrepresented identities, normalizing queer bodies in the media we consume is a very humanizing experience. It’s important that we see queer people not just when we’re talking about queer identities and experiences, but also when we’re talking about everyday normal life experiences like going in for a check-up at the dentist or taking your dog for a walk. Queer people are everywhere, just living our normal daily lives, and there’s no reason we shouldn’t see that represented in media.",

      l:"How the Unsplash community wants to see Pride reflected in stock photography by Anna Selle, Shingi Rice and M. Cooper.",
      dis1:"On Unsplash, Pride month is an invitation for us to reflect on the role stock imagery can play in authentically representing – and celebrating – LGBTQ+ identities. We spoke with three Unsplash contributors about everything from the importance of representation in photography to what Pride means to them.",
      dis2:"Here at Unsplash, we’ve long admired Amy’s bright and bold visuals and clear sense of style. So naturally, we decided to catch up with Amy to learn a little bit more about her interests, photography process, and more",
      q1:"How does your identity and sense of self filter into your work?",
      a1:"The biggest part that identity plays in my photography is what I find myself feeling drawn to make images of. In my own work, I explore a lot of themes of identity and self, but in my freelance work, I also find myself being really excited and engaged in projects that allow me to work with other queer people. There’s a really keen sense of the importance of perception when it comes to queer and trans bodies, and having that lived experience myself helps me to be more thoughtful and compassionate with the people I’m working with.",
      q2:"Why is it so important for stock photography to represent the LGBTQ+ community?",
      a2:"Just like with other historically underrepresented identities, normalizing queer bodies in the media we consume is a very humanizing experience. It’s important that we see queer people not just when we’re talking about queer identities and experiences, but also when we’re talking about everyday normal life experiences like going in for a check-up at the dentist or taking your dog for a walk. Queer people are everywhere, just living our normal daily lives, and there’s no reason we shouldn’t see that represented in media.",

Gender and sexuality are just two parts of our identities, but being able to openly express those two parts of our identities can also open us up to explore so many other parts of ourselves. The vast array of ways that we can present ourselves outwardly to the world is so beautiful to me.",

      q6:"What does Pride mean to you?",
      a6:"Celebrating our beautiful existence and not listening to how the white man has taught us to celebrate ourselves.",

      a7:"Editing is therapy for me, so I tend to listen to music that calms me. Some of my favorites at the moment are Simon & Garfunkel, Bob Dylan, Elliott Smith, Nick Drake—music in that vein. Photographing is a different beast, and I usually listen to some sort of energetic 80’s vibes.",
